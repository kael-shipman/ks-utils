KS Utils
================================================================================================

_A collection of utilities that I use often on my linux desktop and servers._

This repo uses [peekaygee](https://github.com/kael-shipman/peekaygee) to provide packages (currently
only `.deb`, but if someone has interest in preparing packages for other systems, I'd be happy to
build and publish those as well).

My APT repo is [here](https://packages.kaelshipman.me/), and you may also simply download the raw
files from this git repo and use them directly.

## TOC

_NOTE: Documentation for this repo is a work in progress, so most utilities don't have any docs. For
the ones that do, I'll link to them below._
