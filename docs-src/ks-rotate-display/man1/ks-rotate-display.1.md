% KS-ROTATE-DISPLAY(1) Version ::VERSION:: | Rotate display and digitizer in response to physical screen rotations

NAME
====

**ks-rotate-display** â€” A daemon that watches for changes in screen orientation and rotates the display and digitizer accordingly

SYNOPSIS
========

| **ks-rotate-display** \[**--verbose**] **--watch**
| **ks-rotate-display** \[**--verbose**] \[**-d|--digitizer** _grep-pattern_] _normal|left-up|bottom-up|right-up_
| **ks-rotate-display** \[**--version**]
| **ks-rotate-display** \[**-h|--help**]

DESCRIPTION
===========

The --watch form starts a daemon that uses `monitor-sensor` from the `iio-sensor-proxy`
package to watch for changes in the screen orientation and change display settings accordingly.

The command form does the work of actually rotating the display. You can use the command form
on its own without the watch form to just do on-demand rotations. The watch form uses the
command form to execute its adjustments.

Global Options
--------------

--verbose

:   Outputs debugging information on stderr

Command-Form Options
--------------------

-d, --digitizer

:   Set the grep pattern by which to find digitizer devices to rotate (default: `wacom`)

    This pattern filters results from `xinput -list` using `grep -Ei`. If you don't want to rotate
    the digitizer (or don't have one), you can either leave it at default or set it to an impossible
    value, like `a^$`. Note that this can also be set via the `DIGITIZER_GREP` environment variable.

Hooks
-------

post-rotate - `$KS_PLUGIN_PATH/ks-rotate-display-post-rotate`

:   The post-rotate hook is called (if available and executable) at the end of the command form. It
    receives no arguments, but has access to all of the available environment variables. Use
    `--verbose` in the command form to see available environment variables.

ENVIRONMENT
===========

**DIGITIZER_GREP**

:   Set the grep pattern by which to select digitizers to rotate (see `-d, --digitizer` above in
    "Command-Form Options").
